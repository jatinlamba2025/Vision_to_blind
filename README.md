# Vision to Blind

Vision to Blind is an application designed to assist the visually impaired by detecting objects at a distance from the camera and annotating them. This README.md file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and credits to the technologies used.

## Features

### Object Detection with YOLO

The application utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection. YOLO is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that can detect a wide range of objects in real-time. This feature enables Vision to Blind to identify objects in the environment captured by the camera.

### Real-time Processing with MediaPipe

Integration of MediaPipe enables real-time processing of the camera feed. MediaPipe provides a comprehensive library of pre-built components for various computer vision tasks, including hand tracking, face detection, and pose estimation. In Vision to Blind, MediaPipe enhances the application's ability to process live video streams efficiently.

### Image Processing with OpenCV (cv2)

OpenCV (cv2) is utilized for image processing tasks within the application. OpenCV is a powerful library for computer vision and image processing, offering a wide range of functionalities such as image manipulation, feature detection, and object tracking. Vision to Blind leverages OpenCV to enhance the quality of object annotations and improve the overall user experience.

### Annotation for Visually Impaired Individuals

One of the primary features of Vision to Blind is its ability to annotate detected objects. This annotation is designed to aid visually impaired individuals by providing descriptive information about the objects in their surroundings. The annotations can include object names, sizes, positions, and other relevant details, helping users navigate and interact with the environment more effectively.

### User-friendly Interaction

The application is designed with a user-friendly interface to ensure smooth interaction. Users can easily launch the application, initiate object detection, and receive annotated feedback in real-time. Clear instructions and intuitive controls enhance the accessibility of Vision to Blind for both visually impaired users and sighted individuals assisting them.

### Customization and Extensibility

Vision to Blind offers opportunities for customization and extensibility. Users can modify settings such as detection sensitivity, annotation styles, and audio feedback preferences to suit their preferences and needs. The application's modular architecture also allows for future enhancements and integration of additional functionalities to further improve its capabilities.

These features collectively contribute to making Vision to Blind a powerful tool for enhancing the independence and integration of visually impaired individuals into society.
